## GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale) and pGCS (pediatric GCS)

| Component | Adult Response | Pediatric Response (\<2 yo) | Points|  
| --------- | -------------- | --------------------------- | ------|  
|           | Eyes open spontaneously | Open spontaneously | +4 |  
|           | Eye opening to verbal command | Open to verbal stimuli | +3 |  
|   Eye     | Eye opening to pain | Open to pain only | +2 |  
|           | No eye opening | No response | +1 |  
|           | Not testable (eg injury and/or edema) | - | 0 |  
|  |  |  |  
|           | Oriented | Coos, babbles | +5 |  
|           | Confused | Irritable cries | +4 |  
|  Verbal   | Inappropriate words | Cries in response to pain | +3 |  
|           | Incomprehensible sounds | Moans in response to pain | +2 |  
|           | No verbal response | No response | +1 |  
|           | Not testable/intubated | - | 0 |  
|  |  |  |  
|           | Obeys commands | Moves spontaneously/purposefully | +6 |  
|           | Localizes pain | Withdraws to touch | +5 |  
|           | Withdrawal from pain | Withdraws to pain | +4 |  
|  Motor    | Flexion to pain | Flexor posturing to pain | +3 |  
|           | Extension to pain | Extensor posturing to pain | +2 |  
|           | No motor response | No response | +1 |  
|           | Not testable (eg sedation, paralysis) | - | 0 |  

The three sections of the scale are often summed, but there are objections to this usage by many, including the creators of the scale.  
It should be reported as a sum and include the scores of each of the individual components because of the difference in prognostic value and variations of individual components versus the summed score. Example: Total pCGS 12=E3+V4+M5  
In general, a total score of \<\=8 is considered an indication for patient intubation.  

## Shock index

Source: [https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1316/shock-index#evidence](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/1316/shock-index#evidence)

### SI, Adults

Shock index (SI) = Heart rate / Systolic blood pressure  

Values between 0.5-0.7 are believed to be a normal shock index. Higher numbers have been shown to be more sensitive than vital signs alone in diagnosing occult shock, need for transfusion and/or operation.

### SIPA, Children between 4-16

SIPA = max heart rate / min systolic blood pressure

To Do

## Parkland formula for burns

Sources: [https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/83/parkland-formula-burns](https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/83/parkland-formula-burns)  

It calculates the fluid requirements for burn patients in a 24h period.  
Formula: Fluid requirements = tBSA burned(%) x weight(kg) x 4mL  

- The first half of the total requirements should be given the first 8h of 
the burn incident
- The second half is given over the next 16h.  

Estimation of total body surface area (tBSA) burned:  

- Rule of 9s, adults:  
  - 9% each arm
  - 18% each leg
  - 9% head
  - 18% front torso
  - 18% back torso
- Rule of 9s, children:
  - 9% each arm
  - 14% each leg
  - 18% head
  - 18% front torso
  - 18% back torso
