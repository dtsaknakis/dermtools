## Psoriasis

### PASI

Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, quantifies the severity of psoriasis.  

Lesion characteristics, separately scored for head/neck, upper limbs, 
trunk, and lower limbs:  

Lesion severity, to be assessed separately for each body region (head/neck, 
upper limbs, trunk, lower limbs - with that order). Then the points of 
each area should be summed into 4 total values:  

| Lesion characteristic | Severity    | Points |  
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------ |   
|                       | None        | 0      |  
|                       | Slight      | 1      |  
| Erythema              | Moderate    | 2      |  
|                       | Severe      | 3      |  
|                       | Very severe | 4      |  
|                       |             |        |  
|                       | None        | 0      |  
|                       | Slight      | 1      |  
| Induration/thickness  | Moderate    | 2      |  
|                       | Severe      | 3      |  
|                       | Very severe | 4      |  
|                       |             |        |  
|                       | None        | 0      |  
|                       | Slight      | 1      |  
| Desquamation/scaling  | Moderate    | 2      |  
|                       | Severe      | 3      |  
|                       | Very severe | 4      |  

After getting the four lesion severity totals from above, then also assess 
the percentage of the area affected, for each of the 4 areas, noting the 
points that it gives:  

|                       | Percentage  | Points |  
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------ |  
|                       | 0%          | 0      |  
|                       | 1-9%        | 1      |  
|                       | 10-29%      | 2      |  
| % of area affected    | 30-49%      | 3      |  
|                       | 50-69%      | 4      |  
|                       | 70-89%      | 5      |  
|                       | 90-100%     | 6      |  

For each of the 4 areas, multiply its lesion severity by the point(s) of 
the percentage of area affected, getting 4 new numbers.  

Then multiply each of the 4 numbers with the BSA constant that 
corresponds to the relevant area (see below), thus getting 4 new numbers, 
representing the PASI for each area:

| BSA                   | Constants   |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| Head/neck             | 0.1         |
| Upper limbs           | 0.2         |
| Trunk                 | 0.3         |
| Lower limbs           | 0.4         |

Lastly, add the 4 PASI scores of each area to get the total PASI score.  
The maximum score a PASI total can have is 72.  

Interpertation:

- 0-5 none to mild psoriasis
- 6-10 moderate psoriasis
- 11 and above severe psoriasis
